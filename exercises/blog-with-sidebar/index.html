            <h2>Plot</h2>

            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                Near the end of Fimbulwinter, 
                Kratos and Atreus return 
                home—fending off an ambush 
                from a vengeful Freya—to find 
                their wolf Fenrir as he dies. 
                Atreus's grief transforms him 
                into a bear and he battles 
                Kratos before returning to his 
                senses. Thor arrives with Odin, 
                who proposes leaving them alone 
                and keeping Freya away if Atreus 
                abandons searching for Týr. Kratos 
                refuses, dueling Thor to a stalemate. 
                Odin tells Atreus he will leave Kratos 
                alone if the former comes to Asgard. Kratos, 
                Atreus, and Mímir take refuge at Sindri's home
                on a branch of Yggdrasil and rescue a pacifistic 
                Týr in Svartalfheim. At Gróa's shrine in Alfheim, 
                they learn only Asgard is fated for destruction while 
                other realms survive under a new champion, implied to be 
                Atreus as Loki. Kratos and Atreus argue over the latter's 
                supposed destiny.

            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                Atreus is transported to Jötunheim. 
                He meets Angrboda, who shows him a mural
                seemingly foretelling Kratos's death in Ragnarök 
                and Atreus serving Odin. Sworn to secrecy, Atreus 
                is entrusted with spiritual stones containing 
                Giants' souls, putting one into a snake's body, 
                before returning to Midgard. Freya attacks but 
                relents, agreeing to spare Kratos if he breaks the 
                curse binding her to Midgard, which she temporarily 
                circumvents by transforming into a falcon. 
                In Vanaheim, Kratos opens up to Freya about 
                his family's deaths in Greece, his vengeance 
                against Olympus, and the emptiness of revenge. 
                After breaking the curse, Freya and Kratos make amends.

                Ragnarök is set in the world of Norse mythology, 
                taking place three years after the previous game. 
                Unlike that prior entry, all nine realms of Norse 
                mythology are visited as part of the story. Midgard 
                is the primary realm which has become a frigid 
                wasteland, dramatically changed by Fimbulwinter, 
                a three-year long winter that began upon the 
                conclusion of the previous game. The Lake of the 
                Nine, previously navigable by means of a boat, 
                is now frozen over, with Kratos making use of a 
                sleigh and two pet wolves to navigate around the 
                area. The other returning realms include Alfheim, 
                the mystical home of the dark and light Elves; 
                Helheim, the icy land of the dead; Jötunheim, 
                the land of the Giants; the fiery realm Muspelheim, 
                and the fog realm Niflheim, now covered with ice and 
                snow—the latter two were previously optional to 
                explore. The three new realms for Ragnarök include 
                Svartalfheim, the industrial abode of the Dwarves; 
                Vanaheim, the lush home of the Vanir gods as well 
                as the giant wolves Sköll and Hati; and Asgard, the 
                humble home of the Aesir gods that is only visited as 
                part of the story and cannot be accessed after its 
                conclusion. The DLC pack Valhalla adds Valhalla, a 
                remaining area within Asgard where warriors go after 
                death. Within Valhalla are small recreations of the 
                previous realms based on Kratos's memories, as well 
                as areas from his homeland of Greece.

                Sometime after the end of Ragnarök, 
                Kratos receives an anonymous invitation 
                to Valhalla; he and Mímir force their way 
                through its entrance. Kratos's equipment 
                and magical powers are stripped away and 
                he is defeated in combat. Awakening on the
                shores outside the entrance, Kratos and 
                Mímir are confronted by Freya and Sigrun. 
                Freya, now Queen of the Realms, had 
                invited Kratos to join her council as 
                the new God of War but he refused, 
                reluctant to wield such power again 
                after abusing it in Greece.
