        <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
        
        <p>
            Disney tackles Greek mythology in this animated feature. 
            Hercules (Tate Donovan), a son of gods, was snatched as a baby by 
            Hades (James Woods) and forced to live among mortals as a half-man,
            half-god. Now a teenager, Hercules needs to perform a rite of 
            passage on Earth to prove himself worthy of living with the gods on
            Mount Olympus. With his plucky satyr sidekick, Philoctetes 
            (Danny DeVito), along for the ride, Hercules must learn how to use 
            his strength to defeat a series of evil creatures.

        <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

        <p>
            The Fox and the Hound (1981) tells the story of Tod, an orphaned 
            fox, and Copper, a hound puppy, who become best friends despite 
            being raised by different ownersâ€”Widow Tweed and hunter Amos Slade,
            respectively. As they grow, Copper becomes a skilled hunting dog, 
            and their childhood bond faces the challenge of their natural 
            instincts and the societal pressure that forces them to become 
            adversaries, culminating in a dramatic confrontation with a bear 
            and a powerful act of loyalty.
